# Introduction

Welcome to **Mighty BUB**, a light-weight social media platform designed for ease of use and straight forward simplicity.  It is built using MVC Architecture and authorized login.  Individual profiles may create an account, make image posts with titles and descriptions, and then *like* posts that are made to the public feed.
